# Shapifier

Command-line utility to add polygon fields (e.g., name or ID) to point data. Built on the [geojson-geometries-lookup](https://github.com/simonepri/geojson-geometries-lookup) package, Shapifier provides a command-line interface to handle a common use-case: matching point-based data to shape-based bada based on their geometries (i.e., assign states to cities based on their latitude and longitude alone).

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install -g shapifier
```
